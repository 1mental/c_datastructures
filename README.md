# C Data Structures


Lately, I have noticed many different people are unable to code their data structures on C due to the diffucilty of dealing with pointer, so I have decided to code some useful Data Structures and post them on Github.


#Available Data Structures:

Doubly Linked List

Queue (Depends on the LinkedList)

Stack (Depends on the LinkedList)




# How to use?

Just drag the source and header files into your project and use them freely. You don't have to give me any credits. Use them as you wish.


I may create a documentation if I found many interactions on this repository.



# Good Luck!
